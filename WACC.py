# This is a class to calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital or "WACC"

class WACC:

    # re: cost of equity
    # re: cost of debt
    # e: market value of the firm's equity
    # d: market value of the firm's debt
    # v = e + d: total market value of the firmâ€™s financing (equity and debt)
    # pFe = e/v: percentage of financing that is equity
    # pDe = d/v: percentage of financing that is debt
    # Tc: corporate tax rate
